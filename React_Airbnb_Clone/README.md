## Overview
This was my second solo React project after starting to learn React. The goal was to create an airbnb clone. Through this project I was introduced to prop and map.

## Process
I have used React 18 for this project. Started with Create React App and then rendered all the HTML with ReactDOM.render() and styled it with CSS. I also used props and created a reusable Card component that imports data from a file and maps it into every card, creating a different cards with minimal work.
