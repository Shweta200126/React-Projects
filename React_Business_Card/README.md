## Overview
This was my first solo React project after starting to learn React. The goal was to create a business card based on the figma design.

## Process
I started with making folders for different components and compiling the images and then making the required components for header, footer and main section, I then assembled them in App.js file and used index.js to execute it using ReactDOM.render(), then I styled it using CSS.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS
- React

## What I learnt
I learnt the basics of React: what JSX is, how to create components, import and export things between files, and how to deploy a react app on Netlify!
